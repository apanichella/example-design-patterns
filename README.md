# example-design-patterns
This repository contains small examples of (some) design patterns implemented in Java. This project is made for educational purposes and is mostly used for courses taught at TU Delft. Furthermore, this repository contains only some design patterns from Gamma et al. 

Each design pattern comes with (1) a problem description and (2) its corresponding implementation in Java.
