# Problem description

We want to develop an application for creating different **types of documents** and in different **formats**. 

We want to be able to generate different types of documents (e.g., letter, resume, essay, etc.) and, at the same time, allowing to use different formats for these documents (text file, JSON, etc.). We want to make the system **extensible** for more formats and type of documents.

Let's use the **abstract factorty** pattern to implement this scenario.
